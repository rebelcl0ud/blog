This project was initially setup in rails... *the thing is* I started learning with rails and once I shifted into learning Javascript I kept setting it up mainly for practice (didn't want to completely forget things) and to make use of `ENV[variables]` when it came to keys and such.

When it came to creating the Javascript Calculator however-- it really wasn't necessary, not even a little bit. But, out of habit, that's how I set it up.

I had every intention of going back once I was done and migrate only the necessary files from the original repo into a clean repo/project. *Which I did* hence this post :).
 

# calculatorJS

created simple project with only files necessary [eg: html, css, js]

The gist: 

* created project folder
* inside that folder there's an `images` folder, `styles` folder, and `script` folder
* index file with html stands alone in projects folder
* css goes in `styles` folder
* javascript goes in `scripts` folder
* my background image went in `images` folder
* deployed site using surge.sh (had always wanted to try it out, this was my first time)

my edits:

`index.html.erb` => took out erb 
  * not needed as erb is to have ruby within html

`master.css.scss` => took out scss
  * not needed as I didn't have any sass in that file, it was done more out of habit from doing rails proj

`main.js` => created/moved into its own folder, out of `index.html` file

additional edits: 
* had to add jquery link [below] for jquery to work 
* css had diff ext when in rails proj

* had to add script tag for js as well and placed at bottom of html file to allow html to load first

```

another edit `master.css` was for background image to show in browser
* the url needed to be `url(../images/wood.png);`
* the `no-repeat` had to be taken out from next to url, which worked within rails env, but not as standalone-- it had to be placed in its own line `background-repeat:`

```
body {
  background-image: url(../images/wood.png);
  -webkit-background-size: cover;
  -moz-background-size: cover;
  -o-background-size: cover;
  background-size: cover;
  background-repeat: no-repeat center center fixed;
}
```
