I know there are gems/ themes up for snag on the Internet which probably would have been way quicker, but all I wanted was some minor tweaks. I managed to make a few changes, but when I restarted the server... everything reverted. O_O <-- me

*What happened?*  


Do NOT mess with files in `_site`.  


Jekyll only shows you a handful of things. The rest is hiding inside the gem. Naturally, I want in and if you're like me check out [Overriding theme defaults](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/themes/#overriding-theme-defaults) section and for general structure [Directory structure](https://jekyllrb.com/docs/structure/). 

Pretty much the way to customize is to have your own file of whatever you want customized, a copy to tweak which will get sucked through all that `_site` goodness and finally spit out your beautiful edits.  


Personally, I couldn't locate my theme's directory even after unhiding files, but I am a newb so it's totally possible I missed something.  


Since I made a mess the first time I created a new project, left `_site` alone and copied folders/files I wanted to edit (ie: 
  _layouts, _includes, _sass, assets)
  
Adjust css file in assets folder. Personalize title and info in config file... *You get it.*     


To be fair, I should have looked up how to customize first before messing with things, but where's the fun in that?
