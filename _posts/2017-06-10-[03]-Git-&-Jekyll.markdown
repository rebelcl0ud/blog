Jekyll is up and running locally on your machine-- writing posts and/or making it all pretty, but if it's not up on Github already you should probably get on that. *In general, pushing code to Github is a good idea.*  

SETUP GIT (this preps your beautiful site for push/ send off)  

  `$ git init .`  

  `$ git add --all`  

  `$ git commit -m "initial commit"`  


SETUP GITHUB (where your code gets pushed/ sent to)

Go to [Github](https://github.com)
  1. NEW REPO button
  2. NAME it, leave PUBLIC button 
      NOTE: I don't check initialize readme, but if that's what your little heart desires-- go for it. I've seen others do it and nothing blows up :)
  3. CREATE REPO button

After page reloads you'll see a section that says "Push existing repo from command line"  

  NOTE: I used SSH which I believe uses pw already setup, while https will require username/pw each push, but either works.
  
  Copy/paste `git remote add...` then, `git push...` in terminal  

  NOTE: Each command will populate info specific to github acct

If you check Github you should see your files on there. 

Click SETTINGS and head down to GITHUB PAGES section.
Under SOURCE click the dropdown and click MASTER BRANCH or if you created a GH-PAGES branch then choose that one. 
SAVE and you'll see a link like https://username.github.io/repoName/ show up

If all went smooth, congratulations your SITE is LIVE on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/) :)
