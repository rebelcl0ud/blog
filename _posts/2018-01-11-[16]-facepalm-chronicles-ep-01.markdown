Permission Denied /facepalm

While working on a site I realized some time had passed and I hadn't committed changes to Github (don't do this-- save often). So, I went ahead and got that going, but ended up getting something like this...

`Permission denied (publickey).fatal: Could not read from remote repository.`

I looked it up and ended up here: [Github Article - Error Permission Denied](https://help.github.com/articles/error-permission-denied-publickey/)

I went through the article verifying/comparing what was showing up on my end to what I was reading. Obviously, something had gone wrong. Took me a few steps and "WTFs" to finally realize that I use Vagrant and it wasn't running. /facepalm

Putting this one here just in case this ever happens again or to laugh at when looking through my posts later on :D
