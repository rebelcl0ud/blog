During a recent trip I snagged a T410(see: a gift from a kind being) with Ubuntu on it. During the trip I did some minor customizing like oh-my-zsh and Sublime. Made sure Java ran-- I'm still going through Head First Java (was trying to keep up with my reading while out of town). As soon as I returned I got down to "setting up"-- Git, connecting Github so I can start pushing my work, Node, npm, nvm... and of course things don't run 100% smooth so I decided to jot some of my encounters.

Total Linux n00b, I really should have started this as I went, but here goes anyway...

## “System program problem detected” pop-up
It's continuous display was annoying and so not helpful-- telling me I have a problem, but not letting me see what the hell it is from the pop-up... c'mon!

I found the posts below-- I didn't want to remove the pop-up completely, but did clear reports...

## What the hell happened to nvm?
I installed nvm and it seemed to work ok until I tried to use it from another folder. I thought I fixed it, but after a restart I was back to square one.

*What was the issue?*

The gist: turns out during setup there's a line suggested to put into a certain file, like bash-- the line for me had to go into my zsh file because that is the terminal that was being loaded.

Some ways down this [SO post](https://www.binarytides.com/ubuntu-fix-system-program-problem-error/) Karl's answer helped me out.

[TL;DR] add `source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh` to the `~/.zshrc`
