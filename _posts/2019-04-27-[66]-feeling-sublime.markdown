It seems there are [insert w.e number here] different editors floating around... I've dabbled with a few... I dig Sublime. Came across some nice time savers...

In an `html` file:

  - typing `html` followed by `tab` will auto complete the basics of what's needed to get an html file started, ie: `doctype`, `html`, `head`, `title`,  and `body` tags.

  - typing `lorem` followed by hitting `tab` will insert dummy text (aka lorem ipsum text) although that hipsum is pretty amusing to use [hipsum.co](https://hipsum.co/)
  
  - `div#wrapper` + `tab` => `<div id="wrapper"></div>`
  
  - `div.container` + `tab` => `<div class="container"></div>`
