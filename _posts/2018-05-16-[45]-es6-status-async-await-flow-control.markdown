asyncronous vs. syncronous: syncronous is when one thing finishes before another while asyncronous can have a task start, then immediately move on whether that initial task finished or not.

async + await just pauses for certain info without blocking like an alert would do.

note: async + await is built on top of promises, it is not something seperate.
