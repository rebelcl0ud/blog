The following was initially part of the 'Rails Project Checklist of Sorts' post. Figured having a dedicated post would make it easier to find, especially if not working w/ rails, and convenient :)

# SETTING UP REPO  

SETUP GIT  

  `$ git init .`  
  `$ git add --all`  
  `$ git commit -am "initial commit"`  


SETUP GITHUB  

GO to [Github](https://github.com)  

- NEW REPO button  

- NAME it, leave PUBLIC button  
NOTE: DO NOT check initialize readme (default will get generated ready to be edited with specific project info)  

- CREATE REPO button  

AFTER page reloads
"Push existing repo from command line..."  

NOTE:  
SSH will use pw already setup, https will require username/pw each push
  
COPY/PASTE:  
`git remote add...` AND THEN, `git push...` IN TERMINAL  

NOTE: Each command will populate info specific to github acct
