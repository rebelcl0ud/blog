The amount of times I look these up...  
I have screenshots saved, I have notes...  
Yea, I'll be adding to this list. Until then...


# Switching Branches

`$ git checkout -b branch-name-here`  
 _switches to new branch 'branch-name-here'_

Shortcut for:

`$ git branch branch-name-here`  
`$ git checkout branch-name-here`  

# Using Rebase to Update Branch

```
$ git checkout master
$ git pull
$ git checkout other-branch
$ git rebase master
$ git push origin other-branch -f
```

# When you need to delete a branch

`$ git branch -d the-local-branch` 

# When you want to delete untracked files from working branch  

This one I actually only used once and I'm not exactly sure what was the situation, but I jotted it down nonetheless because, well, you never know. There are two posts I saved regarding this topic-- perhaps, I'll look them over and summarize them here or on a seperate post.  

`$ git clean -n` (will show files that would be deleted)  

`$ git clean -f` (will delete files) 

# When you screw up a git merge 

`$ git reset --hard master@{"300 minutes ago"}` to revert back to a certain period of time... before you screwed up :D

That^ little nugget of wisdom came from [@data_stephanie](https://twitter.com/data_stephanie/status/968226587547258886) on Twitter. *I love Twitter*

# Undo local commit

`$ git reset --hard HEAD^` undo without keeping changes made

`$ git reset --soft HEAD^` undo keeps changes BEFORE commit

# Update

First time using this one was to remove a few deleted files.

`$ git add -u` stages already tracked files, does not add new files

# how do I get out of a `git log` situation?

ready? press `Q` key. Yep.

# amend most recent commit message, not pushed

`$ git commit --amend` that will open editor or `git commit --amend -m "new commit message here"` straight from terminal.

link below gives more detail and talks of modifying commit message when already pushed.

# so what about `git stash`?

check out the *stash* using `git stash list`

for the latest stash, `git stash apply` and for a non-recent stash... it will look something like `git stash apply stash@{2}` the number will depend on what is displayed when you check out the list and which one of those you want to apply. Note: using no number, it will be assumed it is the latest stash you're looking to apply.
