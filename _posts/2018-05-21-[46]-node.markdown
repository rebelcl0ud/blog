A post I've had floating about-- updating npm/node and all that jazz.

## updating npm
[reference: npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node)

`npm install npm@latest -g`

for mac, needed `sudo`

## updating nodeJS 

[reference: stackoverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/10075990/upgrading-node-js-to-latest-version#10076029)

UPDATED SO snippet:
```
2019 Solution Without using sudo!

The Stable "LTS" version of node is 10.15.0 (2019-01-13) see: nodejs.org for latest.
Step 1 - Get NVM (Node Version Manger)

curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.11/install.sh | bash

    If you're curious about the installation command read the source code
    ... its been reviewed by several security experts

Step 2 - Install the version of node.js you need

Once you've got NVM you can install a specific version of Node.js using the nvm command:

nvm install v10.15.0

Note: you may need to close & re-open your terminal window for nvm command to be available.

You should expect to see something like this in your terminal:

Now using node v10.15.0

```

2017 Solution Without sudo!

The Current/Stable "LTS" version of node is 8.9.4 (2018-01-24) see: nodejs.org for latest.
Step 1 - Get NVM (Node Version Manger)

`curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/creationix/nvm/v0.33.6/install.sh | bash`

    If you're curious about the installation command read the source code
    ... its been reviewed by several security experts

Step 2 - Install the version of node.js you need

Once you've got NVM you can install a specific version of Node.js using the nvm command:

nvm install v8.9.4

```
once in project folder `npm install` installs dependencies

NOTE: to SWITCH between NODE VERSIONS `nvm use [insert version here]` or ie: (at the time of initial post) `nvm use v8.9.4`
	I noticed every time i got back into my vagrant box node was back to w.e version it was b4 upgrading, then it would say version was already installed so I looked up how to [switch versions](http://michael-kuehnel.de/node.js/2015/09/08/using-vm-to-switch-node-versions.html)

Trying to prevent node version reverting to an older version every time I run a new terminal:
`nvm use default` after setting 8.9.4 as default => `$ nvm alias default 8.9.4`
[restarting reverts version](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/36098765/why-restarting-reverts-the-version-of-node#36099044)

### multiple node versions
Run `nvm ls` to see list of versions 

Run `nvm uninstall 5.0.0` to remove version, replacing the `5.0.0` I have with whatever version you want removed.

This particluar [post](https://davidwalsh.name/nvm), a few years old, but covers most of what I've found prior/written about in previous sections. The reason I throw it in here is because it gave me my `nvm uninstall` I was looking for annnnd seems like a sweet blog to revisit :)
