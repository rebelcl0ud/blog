### promises

Promises are often used when fetching data from APIs, AJAX and such. 

`.fetch()` is similar to `$.ajax()` and `$.getJSON`, however it is not loaded from some type of external library. Instead, is built-in/available in-browser and returns promises. 

*What is a promise?* Like it sounds, an IOU of something that will happen at some point from now till some point in the future, most likely, not immediate.

*Why would we need promises?* Based on the fact that JavaScript is all about being asynchronous, some times things get ran before other things needed are available. Promises are a good way to set up something to run, finish, and then moving on to the next thing.

Example:
```
console.log('Fetching...'); 

const posts = fetch('http://whateverwebsitehere.com/whatever-json/posts');

console.log('Done!');
console.log(posts);

```
^above will result in an console.log output of:
```
Fetching...
Done!
Promise { <state>: "pending" }

```

It goes to fetch whatever data, but doesn't get through it before 'done' is logged. It queues the request, it lets you know in a way that it is working on it and when the info is snagged it will return, hence `Promise { <state>: "pending" }` up there^.

*What can be done?* Using example above:

```
const postsPromise = fetch('http://whateverwebsitehere.com/whatever-json/posts');

postsPromise
  .then(data => data.json())
  .then(data => { console.log(data) })
  .catch(err=> { console.error(err) })

```

`.then()` is similar to `on-click`, meaning it will only run when it clicks or in this case only run when the data comes back.

### building promises

As somewhat mentioned above, promises are pretty much used when you want JS still running while waiting for something else to be dealt with upon completion. This seems pretty handy when waiting on API data.

Below is a simulation of a Promise contructor waiting to resolve. The idea is the setTimeout acts as time waiting on certain data to come through, once that happens we are notified of its resolve.
```
 const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve('This promise was resolved');
  }, 2000); 
 });

 p
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })

```

In similar fashion, below shows promise rejected for whatever reason and having the error caught w/ information regarding error. However, using the `Error()` within `reject()` is what will be caught, directing us to where the Error took place. Without this, error would get caught, but the line shown would be where the catch err was placed and not actual reject/error line.
```
 const p = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    reject(Error('This promise was rejected'));
  }, 2000); 
 });

 p
  .then(data => {
    console.log(data);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error(err);
  })

```

### chaining promises, flow control

Example below mimics snagging info from "database" using Wes's example of posts & authors. Specifically, a post of a certain ID.
```
  const posts = [
    { title: 'I love JavaScript', author: 'Wes Bos', id: 1 },
    { title: 'CSS!', author: 'Chris Coyier', id: 2 },
    { title: 'Dev tools tricks', author: 'Addy Osmani', id: 3 },
  ];

  const authors = [
    { name: 'Wes Bos', twitter: '@wesbos', bio: 'Canadian Developer' },
    { name: 'Chris Coyier', twitter: '@chriscoyier', bio: 'CSS Tricks and CodePen' },
    { name: 'Addy Osmani', twitter: '@addyosmani', bio: 'Googler' },
  ];

function getPostById(id) {
 // promise created
 return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

  // setTimeout to simulate having to wait for some data to come through
  setTimeout(() => {
    // finds post, self-explanatory
    const post = posts.find(post => post.id === id);
    if(post) {
      resolve(post);
    } else {
      reject(Error('No Post Found.'));
    }
  }, 2000);
 });
}

getPostById(2) // once post id snagged
  .then(post => { console.log(post) }); // then, output result

```

When we get back our specified post, posts.author contains name only, to replace that with info from authors object of particular author with more information...

we create another function `snagAuthorInfo(post)` where the post we snagged by ID will get checked for `post.author` matching `authors.name` in authors array of objects. If one is found, the author obj will then replace the `post.author` string. If none found, an error will return stating no author was found.
```
  const posts = [
    { title: 'I love JavaScript', author: 'Wes Bos', id: 1 },
    { title: 'CSS!', author: 'Chris Coyier', id: 2 },
    { title: 'Dev tools tricks', author: 'Addy Osmani', id: 3 },
  ];

  const authors = [
    { name: 'Wes Bos', twitter: '@wesbos', bio: 'Canadian Developer' },
    { name: 'Chris Coyier', twitter: '@chriscoyier', bio: 'CSS Tricks and CodePen' },
    { name: 'Addy Osmani', twitter: '@addyosmani', bio: 'Googler' },
  ];

function getPostById(id) {
 // promise
 return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

  // setTimeout to simulate having to wait for some data to come through
  setTimeout(() => {
    // finds post, self-explanatory
    const post = posts.find(post => post.id === id);
    if(post) {
      resolve(post);
    } else {
      reject(Error('No Post Found.'));
    }
  }, 2000);
 });
}

function snagAuthorInfo(post) {
  // new promise
  return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {

    // find author
    const authorDeets = authors.find(author => author.name === post.author);
    // if author, replace org author string with author object
    if(authorDeets) {
      post.author = authorDeets;
      resolve(post);
    } else {
      reject(Error('No Author Info Found'));
    }
  })
}

getPostById(3)
  .then(post => { 
    // console.log(post) 
    return snagAuthorInfo(post) // returning a promise allows to chain another then()
  })
  .then(post => {
    console.log(post);
  })
  .catch(err => {
    console.error(err);
  })

```
^stepped, waited for post to arrive before finding the author because we needed the author of the post first before being able to populate the author-- one thing needed to happen before the next thing.

*So, how about firing all at once?*

### multi-promises

```
const weather = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve({ temp: 92, conditions: 'Nothing but SUN, pack that sunscreen and hit the beach'});
  }, 5000);
});

const tweets = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  setTimeout(() => {
    resolve(['Friday the 13th is tomorrow :D', 'Ceviche is life!'])
  }, 1000);
});

// ^nothing to do with eachother, instead of chaining .then(), Promise.all()

// create promise and pass array of promises
Promise
  .all([weather, tweets])
  .then(responses => {
    console.log(responses); 
  });

```
^the return happens after the longest amount of time to resolve, even if there's one promise faster than another-- in this case it will come back in 5 sec because thats how long it takes for ALL promises to resolve before .then() runs

reponses throws out a combo of info from both weather and tweets, sprinkle some destructurizing to seperate info into 2 sep variables:
```
Promise
  .all([weather, tweets])
  .then(responses => {

  // throwing in some destructure sweetness
  const [weatherDeets, tweetsDeets] = responses;
    
  // outputs data into 2 sep variables
  console.log(weatherDeets, tweetsDeets); 
  });

```

Using a real API:

NOTE: need server when using `fetch()`, opening up file in browser will not work. `browser-sync` is an option if you don't have an alternative way of running a server.

First snag: Tried using my weatherapp on this section since it calls 2 APIs, but turns out the API I'm using to grab weather info gives me an error when using fetch instead of AJAX/JSONP. Looking into it I realize I remember running into this when I first set it up. Going into the docs they suggest proxy server and state disabling CORS on their servers which I remember looking into, however since I was a bit more brand new at the time it was something I always wanted to return to and implement. Looks like I got my reminder :D

As an alternative, I've replaced the weather API with a street cars API used in vid example.

```
const getCityPromise = fetch(`https://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?latlng=${latitude}, ${longitude}&key=<%=ENV['GEO_KEY']%>`);

const getStreetCarsPromise = fetch('http://data.ratp.fr/api/datasets/1.0/search/?q=paris');

Promise
  .all([getCityPromise, getStreetCarsPromise])
  .then(responses => {
    console.log(responses);
})

```

NOTE: The `getCityPromise` is actual API being used on my live app. The above snippet may look a little odd-- I'm using template string for lat/long that I'm grabbing using geolocation and the key is hidden using ENV variables from Rails.

`console.log()` shows no data coming through yet, readable stream needs to be converted into JSON. Below, once initial promises come back we run through array of responses/data to convert to JSON, which returns a second promise that we can then call to log responses.

```
Promise
  .all([getCityPromise, getStreetCarsPromise])
  .then(responses => {
    return Promise.all(responses.map(res => res.json()));
  })
  .then(responses => console.log(responses));

```

SIDEBAR on `return Promise.all(responses.map(res => res.json()));`:

*Why are we calling `return Promise.all(responses.map(res => res.json()));` 
and not something like `return Promise.all(responses.map(res => JSON.parse(res))); or something`?*

Because, there are many different types of data that can come back. Ex: arrayBuffer(), blob(), json(), text(), formData(). In other words, don't assume AJAX requests will always be JSON.
