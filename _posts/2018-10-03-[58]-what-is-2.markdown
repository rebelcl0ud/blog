This 'What is...' post comes post phone intro/screen/meet I had earlier today with an edu startup. When asked the following questions, although familiar with general gist, I didn't go too much further in detail. Not sure if this ended up hurting or not, but decided to read up and jot down a bit more info so if ever asked again, perhaps having written this will help.

1. HTTP vs. HTTPS
The gist: HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) is *secure* connection, while HTTP is not.

Differences:

HTTPS transmits data safely and securely. For example: a site that involves transactions would be HTTPS. A quick visual confirmation would be to check out the address bar at the top and look for a padlock.

Ports differ. By default, HTTP uses Port 80 while HTTPS uses Port 443 for communication. 

Layers differ. HTTP operated at application layer while HTTPS operated at transport layer.

Sidebar: What is application and transport layer? They are 2 of 7 OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model layers; conceptual model characterizing communication functionality of telecommunication/ computing system. The layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OSI_model

Encryption. HTTP: no encryption. HTTPS: uses encryption.

Certificates: HTTP doesn't require them, HTTPS does.

2. Float(CSS)
A positioning property. It specifies where an element should be placed (left/right) of its container; it allows text/ inline elements to wrap around whatever element positioned (the float element). Although the element is removed from the normal *flow* of the page it still remains as part of the *flow* unlike with absolute positioning.

3. Media Queries
Used for responsive design. Used to modify site/app depending on device type or specifics like screen resolution or browser window size.

4. Using a script tag in the head section vs script tag at the bottom of the file, what's the difference?

`script` tag is used to reference/ embed code such as JavaScript at the end of the file, placed there so html has chance to load before JavaScript is executed.

Using `script` tag in `head` is for loading a library of sorts, like jQuery. They are things used to process the page.

5. Git
A type of version control that keeps track of source code files/changes.
